**1. What name, with at least 5 games, do you want considered as your best attempt?**

Aidans Final

**2. How many average points did you have on the leaderboard when you submitted your work?**

i have no idea, it looks like you dissabled points, mean, and games on the leaderboard. it's 15th on the leaderboard as of 5pm, on saturday dec 7th. 

sidenote: i wonder what you did to the leaderboard, cause there were tons of people beating eggman the other day, now there's only 4.

**3. What strategy did you use?**

my bot takes the first guess from the usable list, which is ordered by probibility, with all the vowels in back, because they dont give any points.

**4. How could you improve your strategy do do even better?**

implement some tie-in to the pattern matcher, i never touched the todo line, i wasn't sure what to add. ALSO it took me like 3 days to make something really simple that worked (granted it doesn't beat eggman), I need to get better at not overcomplicating problems, it's my biggest faliure.
