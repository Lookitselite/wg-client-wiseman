**1. What name, with at least 5 games, do you want considered as your best attempt?**

aidanBackup

**2. How many average points did you have on the leaderboard when you submitted your work?**

4.083333 repeating

**3. What strategy did you use?**

i tried to have it loop through a frequency list, and use that to guess, but it never worked, it just slowly shoved the same guess in over and over. i tried updating the guess pusher, adding guesses directly to the guess set, but nothing worked. i ended up just copying the base file to a file called playBackup, running that a bunch, and going with that, because it honestly had a better score than my work.

**4. How could you improve your strategy do do even better?**

understand how the backend works. I cannot for the life of me to get guesses to work, it just loops over and over and over on the same guess. eggman doesn't even run.
